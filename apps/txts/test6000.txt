so the second wave of Spamton’s SPECIL Fun Pak!!! from fanger shipped out and i got mine. of great interest to me was the air freshener. not only because it displays a clearer image of big shot-era spamton in a red suit and yellow tie reminiscent of mettaton’s TV host outfit, but had singlehandedly changed how the whole fandom perceived how he looked back in the day.

but also the smell. even though multiple people had commented on how potent it was, i only heard two specific descriptions: one said it smelled like cologne, and another, my friend, said it “reeks of grass and citrus. aromatic hell. it smells like someone dumped a gallon of cheap fragrance on him instead of making him take a shower,” and that they could “STILL SMELL IT THROUGH THE CABINET IN WHICH HE IS IMPRISONED”

so i knew that as soon as this pack arrived, i would open it holding my breath and take a giant whiff, nostrils right on the freshener. and that’s exactly what i did. you can’t really expect to know the way something smells until you actually smell it. but regardless, what i think what most accurately gets it across is “kitchen cleaning agent with cologne and shaving cream undertones”

but this is actually a known smell. and it’s likely you’ve smelled it before: it has nearly the same smell as the Black Ice freshener from Little Trees. upon looking up the scent, Black Ice has quite a collective reputation and implications tied into it that are think are simultaneously hilarious and rather sad in the context of spamton.

i googled “black ice smell” and there were tons of reddit posts about it that were downright hilarious that gave me a lot of insight not only into the nature of how people feel about the smell but its collective Lore and what it symbolizes. yeah this scent has lore.

here are some favorite excerpts so you get an idea of how people generally feel about it:

    • “When it literally face fucks you as soon as you open the door it’s a problem. And recently it’s been like every single Uber I’ve taken. My throat hurts, my eyes burn, I feel like I’m getting exposed to carcinogens. I don’t want to screw drivers over by down rating them from the ridiculous stench but DAMN”
    • “It’s the Axe deodorant of car air fresheners”
    • “Seen these all the time in ratty Uber/Lyft cars. Occasionally the Black Ice stench sticks to me so strongly that I’ve had to shower and change (and launder the clothes immediately so they don’t contaminate my laundry basket).”
    • “It’s definitely the worst smelling tree of the air freshener family. It smells like a large Italian man in an Adidas track suit is sitting behind me.”
    • “Jesus Christ. I had ONE of those in my car back in high school and it was so strong that I couldn’t breathe without coughing. How does that person have so many without going into shock?”
    • “every time you get out of your car people should either have an allergic reaction to the strength of the scent or wonder wtf you’re trying to cover up smell-wise.”
    • “Pulling that odor into my nose makes me think of my expired grandfather’s cologne having sex with a ten-cent whore”
    • “Black ice smells like teenage angst it is as far as you can get from old lady’s… smells like a 14 year axe bombed himself”
    • “It smells like douchebag but I like it”

    there are more comments you should read here

apparently this scent’s potency is well-known for being utilized by people who smoke weed in the car to cover up substance stench. except instead of actually neutralizing the potency like milk to capsaicin, it just layers itself on top of it, resulting in a chemical cacophony to your senses. people trying to hide the smell of illegal substances tend to take like at LEAST 10 of these trees and hang them up in the car in what is known as a “felony forest”. this is so well known that cops will apparently recognize more than two air fresheners, especially of this specific scent, as being suspicious because of how potent it is for covering up smells.

another the thing with these Little Trees things are that you’re supposed to keep them inside the plastic and cut a small bit of it open like the instructions say to do, otherwise the scent is overwhelming. but people don’t know that and crack open the entire thing and the smell gets EVERYWHERE, especially one as pungent as this. so that makes it even funnier somehow.

not only this, but the smell itself is just tacky. it’s trashy, as you can probably infer from the above comments. it’s so fake. and i think that is also a big part for why it works for spamton. there’s no natural analogue equivalent.

a person on reddit replying to someone born without a sense of smell who asked what Black Ice was like described it perfectly this way:

    “it’s unpleasant to a lot of people. A smell that does not have an analogue existing in nature. that’s pretty much all you need to know.
    edit: little trees’ own website describes it as “A mysteriously enticing masculine scent of woods and citrus.”
    i guess i can see that but to me it is damn rank. like terrible cologne on a dude with bad body odor. Not to mention, these synthesized scents are not a perfect match to their natural counterparts. Like how Grape bubblegum tastes like the color purple; a strawberry little tree air freshener does not smell like any strawberry ive ever consumed. so imagine someone mixing chemicals to come up with the smell of “mystery, masculinity, the woods, and citrus"”

but like. you have to think about this now. i love the implications and symbolism of this. fangamer knew what they were doing by choosing Black Ice as the scent. it’s so trashy. it smells synthetic, it’s like the neon green and orange of smells. it’s so pungent and cheap, so much so that it’s used en masse in cars to mask unwanted smells, especially weed smoke. this miasmic aura it gives off carries with it embedded assumptions. you just know what you’re getting into. i don’t think there’s another air freshener scent out there with this kind of reputation.
